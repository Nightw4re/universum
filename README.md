Enter a world of limitless exploration and interdimensional travel with the Stargate-inspired mods! This modpack brings the iconic Stargate technology directly into your Minecraft world, opening doors to new adventures and discoveries.

Since Minecraft has its worlds and is based on what people like, we are aiming with this modpack to evolve your progress from Minecraft. You will start playing Minecraft as you know with QoL features that make the world more driven to write your story in predefined worlds.

## What can you find in this modpack?

*   Functional Stargate: Build your own Stargate and explore new dimensions, planets, and worlds.
*   Wide Range of Destinations: Travel to predefined dimensions inspired by the Stargate universe or discover generated dimensions with unique biomes and resources.
*   Advanced Technologies: Utilize futuristic technologies such as advanced weapons and tools to help you survive in unknown worlds.
*   New Resources and Materials: Gain access to new resources and materials essential for building and operating the Stargate and other advanced technologies.
*   Custom Dimensions: The modpack dives you into various dimensions with customizable biomes, resources, and properties.

## Important modifications

*   Infinite AE2 channels – 8 for the small ones and 32 for the dense ones – are a thing of the past.
*   Crossmod compatibility changes - such as Steel Ore(from Stellaris mod) can no longer be generated in the world.
*   You can find MineColonies - which is counted as an optional mod for everyone, to play the game differently.
*   Silent scale power, mob scaling has been reduced by 50%
*   Custom quests
*   Removed Apotheosis Towers and Barbarian camps from Minecolonies to have a more vanilla-style overworld.
